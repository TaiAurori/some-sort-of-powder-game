# some-sort-of-powder-game
a powder game i'm making in c++

so far we got:
- adding elements (left click)
- removing elements (right click)
- changing the element to be placed (scrolling)
- powder elements piling up

this game uses SFML 

i added comments and stuff

the real good stuff is in the .cpp file
